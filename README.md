# Compilation
To compile, use the .NET SDK's `dotnet` command.

No special arguements are required.

# Usage
It is recommended you create a Task Scheduler task to run the program hidden on startup, automatically.

(Personally, I use [run-hidden](https://github.com/stax76/run-hidden).)

Although, you can run it directly through the terminal, with logs and a quit option.
